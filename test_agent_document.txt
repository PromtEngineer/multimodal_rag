ENHANCED RAG SYSTEM TEST DOCUMENT

Company: TechCorp Innovation Labs
Date: December 27, 2024
Document Type: Technical Specification

OVERVIEW
========
This document describes the enhanced multimodal RAG system with advanced agent capabilities. The system has been upgraded with model-aware thinking token support, index-specific overview management, and improved streaming functionality.

KEY FEATURES
============

1. Model Capability Detection
   - Automatically detects whether models support thinking tokens
   - Supports Gemma models (no thinking) and Qwen models (with thinking)
   - Smart thinking control: disabled for fast operations, enabled for reasoning

2. Index-Specific Overviews
   - Per-index document overview support
   - Fallback to global overviews when index-specific not available
   - Enhanced triage system using document context

3. Streaming Support
   - Full async streaming for all LLM operations
   - Enhanced stream_completion_async method in OllamaClient
   - Real-time token streaming for better user experience

4. Enhanced Caching
   - Semantic similarity caching with embedding comparison
   - Session-aware or global cache scoping
   - TTL-based cache management

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS
========================

Model Support:
- Qwen models: qwen3:8b, qwen3:0.6b, qwen2.5vl:7b (thinking enabled)
- Gemma models: gemma:7b, gemma3n:e4b (thinking disabled)
- Automatic detection based on model name prefixes

System Requirements:
- Python 3.11+
- Ollama server running locally
- LanceDB for vector storage
- FastAPI for backend services

Performance Metrics:
- Query processing: < 2 seconds average
- Index creation: 50 documents per minute
- Cache hit ratio: 85%+ with semantic similarity

USAGE EXAMPLES
==============

Basic Query:
"What are the key features of the enhanced RAG system?"

Technical Query:
"How does the model capability detection work for different LLM types?"

Performance Query:
"What are the performance metrics for query processing?"

CONFIGURATION
=============

The system supports multiple configuration profiles:
- default: Full-featured with verification and reranking
- fast: Speed-optimized with minimal processing
- react: ReAct agent with tool usage
