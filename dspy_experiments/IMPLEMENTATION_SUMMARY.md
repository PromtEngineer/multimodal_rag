## 🚀 Key Achievements

### **1. Automated Prompt Optimization**
```python
# Before (Manual): Complex prompt engineering
prompt = "Given the context: {context}\nAnswer the question: {question}\nProvide a clear and accurate response..."

# After (DSPy): Declarative signatures
class ContextualQA(dspy.Signature):
    """Answer questions using provided context documents."""
    context = dspy.InputField(desc="relevant text passages")
    question = dspy.InputField(desc="the user's question")
    answer = dspy.OutputField(desc="answer based on context")
```

### **2. Intelligent Multi-Hop Reasoning**
```python
# DSPy automatically:
# 1. Decomposes complex questions
# 2. Plans retrieval hops
# 3. Checks information sufficiency
# 4. Refines search queries
# 5. Synthesizes final answers
```

### **3. Self-Verification and Correction**
```python
# Automatic verification loop:
result = rag("complex question")
verification = verify_answer(result.answer, context)
if verification.status != "accurate":
    corrected_result = self_correct(result, verification.suggestions)
```

result = rag('Your question here')
print(result.answer)
"
```

### **Integration Examples**
```python
# Use DSPy RAG alongside current system
from dspy_experiments.modules.rag_modules import AdvancedRAG
from rag_system.main import get_agent

# Current system
current_agent = get_agent("default")
current_result = current_agent.run("question")

# DSPy system
dspy_rag = AdvancedRAG()
dspy_result = dspy_rag("question")

# Compare results
print(f"Current: {current_result}")
print(f"DSPy: {dspy_result.answer}")
print(f"DSPy reasoning: {dspy_result.reasoning}")
```
