The overview MUST be a single sentence and include the following key information, if available:
- Document Type (e.g., Invoice, Research Paper, Report, Agreement, Resume)
- Key Entities (e.g., companies, people, products)
- Specific Identifiers (e.g., invoice numbers, report IDs, dates)
- Main Topic

OVERVIEW: "A research paper by Dr. Rostova and Dr. Romanov on quantum entanglement in multi-modal AI systems."
